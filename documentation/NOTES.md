# Hardware

Many STM32 MCUs provides an interface for digital camera connection (DCMI), and some its generalization for parallel input-output (PSSI).
These interfaces can be used for digital signal acquisition. In case of DCMI it is up to 14 lines, and PSSI supports 16 lines.

Both DCMI/PSSI use external clock for data input, its maximum frequency vary between MCU families. This clock is generated by one of the timers.

| MCU family | Controller | Supported lines | Maximum frequency |
| ---------- | +--------+ | --------------+ | ----------------+ |
| STM32F407VE | DCMI | 12 |  42 |
| STM32F407ZG | DCMI | 14 |  42 |
| STM32H723ZG | PSSI | 16 | 100 |
| STM32H743VG | DCMI | 12 |  80 |
| STM32H750VB | DCMI | 12 |  80 |
